# Travelling Salesman Exploring

After watching this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A I wanted to try to implement some of this in Godot.

So far I just have the basic travelling salesman working.

TODO:
 - Figure out ant colony optimization using the same town map
 - Figure out ant colony with mockup of ant tunnels
 - Look into using this for creating paths that npcs walk on
 - Figure out slime mold algorithms
 - Setting up animations?
 - Animations with ants leaving paths where they walk
